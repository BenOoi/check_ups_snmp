Information Instalation plugin check_ups_snmp

requirements
- Net-SNMP

This plugin is a linux script, to install, copy it into the path of nagios plugins
(usually in / usr / local / nagios / libexec ) and define a command in nagios command.cfg file.

Definition example in command.cfg nagios :

define command {
        command_name check_ups_snmp
        command_line $ USER1 $ / $ HOSTADDRESS check_ups_snmp.sh -H $ ARG1 $ -p -C $ ARG2 $ - w $ ARG3 $ - c $ ARG4 $
        register 1
}

Once done , we must define a service for each parameter to be monitored in the service configuration file :

define service {
        host_name UPS_1
        service_description ups_alarm
        use ups_template
        check_command check_ups_snmp ! snmp ! ups_alarm 0, 0, ! -d / usr / local / nagios / libexec / mibs
        register 1
}

For correct use of ups_alarm option, including mibs in the /mibs directory are needed , they are needed to
correctly interpret of the alarms that can give for snmp ups , in this case , as seen in the example of defining
service , copy mibs files on path '/usr/local/nagios/libexec/mibs' but could be anywhere else .

Pnp4nagios graphics templates are included, for install it, you must copy the file check_ups_snmp.php in '/share/templates'
in pnp4nagios home directory.
