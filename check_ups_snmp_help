Description:
check_ups_snmp.sh is a Nagios plugin to check by snmp a sai status with CS121 adapter.
With performance data

Use:
./check_ups_snmp.sh -H <ip_address> -p <option>

Example:
./check_ups_snmp.sh -H 10.40.80.1 -p battery_temp -w 25 -c 40

OPTIONS:
-H|--hostname)
   Sets the hostname. Default is: localhost
-C|--community)
   Sets the snmp read community ('public' by default)
-p|--parameter)
   Sets the parameter you want monitorize (see available parameters below)
-h|--help)
   Show help
-c|--critical
   critical value
-w|--warning
   warning value
-d|--dir
   mibs files directory ('./mibs' by default)
PARAMETERS:
ups_alarm:The present number of active alarm conditions. If number is zero, status is OK, if > 0 the status is CRITICAL
          If an alarm is present, the plugin show the upsAlarmDescr and upsAlarmTime, if you want show the text description of
          the oid upsAlarmDescr, you must define the directory of the mibs files with -d Option (./mibs by default)
battery_temp :The ambient temperature at or near the UPS Battery casing.
             warninig and critical values requiered
output_load :The percentage of the UPS power capacity presently being used on this output line,
             i.e., the greater of the percent load of true power capacity and the percent load of VA.
             warning and critical requiered.
input_voltage :The magnitude of the present input voltage in the input lines.
             normal value, interval warning and interval critical requiered
             Example: normal value is 400V, warning in 395-405 V interval and critical 390-410 V interval
             use: ./check_ups_snmp.sh -H 10.40.80.1 -p input_voltage -w 395:405 -c 390:400
             in the example, normal value is 400V, warning in 395-405 V interval and critical 390-410 V interval
num_input_lines :The number of input lines utilized in this device. This variable indicates the
             number of rows in the input table, percent warning and critical no requiered.
num_output_lines :The number of output lines utilized in this device. This variable indicates the
             number of rows in the output table, warning and critical no requiered.
battery_status :The indication of the capacity remaining in the UPS system's batteries.
             A value of batteryNormal indicates that the remaining run-time is greater than upsConfigLowBattTime.
             A value of batteryLow indicates that the remaining battery run-time is less than or
             equal to upsConfigLowBattTime.  A value of batteryDepleted indicates that the UPS will be unable
             to sustain the present load when and if the utility power is lost (including the possibility that the
             utility power is currently absent and the UPS is unable to sustain the output).warning and critical no requiered. 
             No perfdata show.
battery_charge_remain: An estimate of the battery charge remaining expressed as a percent of full charge and minutes.
             Warning and critical required and refered to the percent of charge
